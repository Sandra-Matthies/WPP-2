A generalization of the notion of ATN grammar, called a cascaded ATN(CATN), is prescribed.  CATN's permit a decomposition of complex language
understanding behavior into a sequence of cooperating ATN's with separate
domain of responsibility, where each stage (called an ATN transducer)
takes its input from the output of the previous stage.  The paper includes
an extensive discjussion of the principles of factoring-conceptual
factoring reduces the number of places that a given fact needs to be
represented in a grammar, and hypothesis factoring reduces the number
of distinct hypotheses that have to be considered during parsing.
