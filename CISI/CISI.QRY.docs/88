The question is asked whether it is feasible to use subsets ofnatural languages as query languages for data bases in actual applications
using the question answering system "USER SPECIALTY LANGUAGES" (USL).
Methods of evaluating a natural language based information system will
be discussed.  The results (error and language structure evaluation)
suggest how to form the general architecture of application systems which
use a subset of German as query language.
