A new type of natural language parser is presented.  The idea behindthis parser is to map input sentences into the deepest form of the
representation of their meaning and inferences, as is appropriate.  The
parser is not distinct from an entire understanding system.  It uses an
integrated conception of inferences, scripts, plans and other knowledge to
aid in the parse.  Furthermore, it does not attempt to parse everything it
sees.  Rather, it determines what is most interesting and concentrates on
that, ignoring the rest.
