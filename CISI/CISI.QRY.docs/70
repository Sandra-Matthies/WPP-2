Decision Support Systems (DSS) represent a concept of the role ofcomputers within the decision making process.  The term has become a
rallying cry for researchers, practitioners, and managers concerned that
Management Science and Management Information Systems fields have become
unnecessarily narrow in focus.  As with many rallying cries, the term is
not well defined.  For some writers, DSS simply mean interactive systems
for use by managers.  To others, the key issue is support, rather than
system.  They focus on understanding and improving the decision process;
a DSS is then designed using any available and suitable technology. Some
researchers view DSS as a subfield of MIS, while others regard it as an
extension of Management Science techniques.  The former define Decision
Support as providing managers with access to data and the latter as giving
them access to analytic models.

    The key argument of this paper is that the term DSS is relevant to
situations where a "final" system can be developed only through an
adaptive process of learning and evolution.  The design strategy must
then focus on getting finished; this is very different from Management
Science and Data Processing approaches.  The research issued for DSS
center around adaption and evolution; they include managerial learning
representation of tasks and user behavior, design architecture and
strategies for getting started.
