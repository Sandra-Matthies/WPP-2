This paper is intended to propose a new methodological approach tothe conception and development of natural language understanding systems.
This new contribution is supported by the design, implementation, and
experimentation of DONAU:  a general purpose domain oriented natural
language understanding system developed and presently running at the Milan
Polytechnic Artificial Intelligence Project.  The system is based on a two
level modular architecture intended to overcome the lack of flexibility and
generality often pointed out in many existing systems, and to facilitate
the exchange of results and actual experiences between different projects.
The horizontal level allows an independent and parallel development of the
single segments of the system (syntactic analyser, information extractor,
legality controller).  The vertical level ensures the possibility of changing
(enlarging or redefining) the definition of the semantic domain on which each
particular version of the system is oriented and specialized in a simple,
incremental, and user-oriented way.  In the paper the general architecture of
the system and the mode of operation of each segment are illustrated in
detail.  Linguistic models, knowledge representation, and parsing algorithms
are described and illustrated by means of selected examples.  Performance
evaluations of the system in the application version on data base inquiry are
reported and discussed.  Promising directions for future research are presented
in the conclusions.
