In this paper we describe a practical method of partial-match retrievalin very large data files.  A binary code word, called a descriptor, is
associated with each record of the file.  These record descriptors are
then used to form a derived descriptor for a block of several records,
which will serve as an index for the block as a whole; hence, the name
"indexed descriptor files."

    First the structure of these files is described and a simple, efficient
retrieval algorithm is presented.  Then its expected behavior, in terms of
storage accesses, is analyzed in detail.  Two different file creation
procedures are sketched, and a number of ways in which the file organization
can be "tuned" to a particular application is suggested.
