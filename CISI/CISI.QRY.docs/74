Recenty technological advances and the success of OCLC, Inc. has ledto the emergence of three additional nonprofit library networks:  the
Research Libraries Information Network (RLIN) of the Research Libraries
Group, Inc., the University of Toronto Library Automation System (UTLAS),
and the Washington Library Network (WLN).  This paper examines the economic
and technological factors affecting the evolution of these networks and
also explores the role of those state and regional (multistate) networks
that broker OCLC services.  The competitive and cooperative nature of
network relationships is a major theme of the discussion.
