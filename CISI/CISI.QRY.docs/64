It is argued that in information science we have to distinguishphysical, objective, or document space from perspective, subjective, or
information space.  These two spaces are like maps and landscapes: each
is a systematic distortion of the other.  However, transformation can be
easily made once the two spaces are distinguished.  If the transformations
are omitted we only get unhelpful physical solutions to information problems.
