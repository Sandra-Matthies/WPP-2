A method of iterative searching, using the results of one iteration searchto formulate the next iteration search, was applied to a full-text database
consisting of some 2400 documents and 1,3000,000 text-words of Hebrew and
Aramaic.  The iterative method consists of clustering the documents returned
in an iteration, using weighting by proximity and by frequency simultaneously.
The process produces searchonyms, which are terms synonymous to keywords in the
context of a single query.  Augumenting or replacing keywords by searchonyms
via manual or automatic feedback leads to the formulation of the next iteration
search.  The results of the experiment are consistent with those of an earlier
small-scale experiment on an English database, and indicate that in contrast
to global clustering where the size of matrices limits applications to small
databases and improvements are doubtful, local metrical methods appear to be
well suited to arbitrarily large databases, improving precision and recall
simultaneously.  Further experiments using more test-queries run on even
larger databases should be made to collect further evidence as to the
performance of these methods.
