Passage retrieval (already operational for lawyers) has advantages inoutput form opver references retrieval and is economically feasible.
Previous experiments in passage retrieval for scientists have demonstrated
recall and false retrieval rates as good or better than those of present
reference retrieval services.  The present experiment involved a greater
variety of forms of retrieval question.  In addition, search words were
selected independently by two different people for each retrieval question.
The search words selected, in combination with the computer procedures used
for passage retrieval, produced average recall ratios of 72 and 67%,
respectively, for the two selectors.  The false retrieval rates were (except
for one predictably difficult question) respectively 13 and 10 falsely
retrieved sentences per answer-paper retrieved.
