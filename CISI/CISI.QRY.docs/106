A set of experiments was conducted to determine the suitability of theColon Classification as a foundation for the automated analysis, representation
and retrieval of primary information from the full text of documents.  Primary
information is that information embodied in the text of a document, as opposed
to secondary information which is generally in such forms as:  an abstract, a
table of contents, or an index.
    Full text databases were created in two subject areas and queries solicited
from specialists in each area.  An automated full text indexing system, along
with four automated passage retrieval systems, was created to test the various
features of the Colon Classification.  Two Boolean-based systems and one simple
word occurrence system were created in order to compare the retrieval results
against types of systems which are in more common use.  The systems' retrieval
performances were measured using recall and precision and the mean expected
search length reduction factors.
    Overall, it was found that the Colon Classification-based systems did not
perform significantly better than the other systems.
