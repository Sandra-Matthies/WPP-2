The "Office of the Future," "Office Technology," "Word Processing,""Electronic Mail," "Electronic Communications," "Convergence," "Information
Management."  These are all terms included in the current list of buzz words
used to describe current activities in the office technology area.  The high
level of investment in factories and plants and the ever-increasing fight to
improve productivity by automating the dull, routine jobs are usually quoted
and compared with the extremely low investment in improving and automating
the equally tedious routine jobs in the office environment; the investment
in the factory is quoted as being ten times greater per employee than in the
office.  This, however, is changing rapidly and investment on a large scale
is already taking place in manhy areas as present-day inflation bites hard,
forcing many companies and organizations to take a much closer look at their
office operations.
