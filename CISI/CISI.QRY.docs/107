A study was carried out of the relationship between the vocabulary ofuser queries and the vocabulary of documents relevant to the queries, and
the value of adding to the document description record in a retrieval system
keywords from previous queries for which the document had proved useful.
Two test databases incorporating user query keywords were implemented at
the School of Library and Information Science, University of Western
Ontario.  Clustering of the documents via title and user keywords, a
statistical analysis of title-user keyword co-occurrences, and retrieval
tests were used to examine the effect of the added keywords.  Results
showed the impracticality of the procedure in an operational setting, but
indicated the value of analyses with sample data in the development and
maintenance of keyword dictionaries and thesauri.
