Approximate matching of strings is reviewed with the aim ofsurveying techniques suitable for finding an item in a database when
there may be a spelling mistake or other error in the keyword.  The
methods found are classified as either equivalence or similarity problems.
Equivalence problems are seen to be readily solved using canonical forms.
For similarity problems difference measures are surveyed, with a full
description of the well-established dynamic programming method relating
this to the approach using probabilities and likelihoods.  Searches for
approximate matches in large sets using a difference function are seen to
be an open problem still, though several promising ideas have been
suggested.  Approximate matching (error correction) during parsing is
briefly reviewed.
