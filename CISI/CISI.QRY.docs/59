The retrieval performance of book indexes can be measured in terms oftheir ability to direct a user selectively to text material whose identity
but not location is known.  The method requires human searchers to base
their searching strategies on actual passages from the book rather than on
test queries, natural or contrived.  It circumvents the need for relevance
judgement, but still yields performance indicators that correspond
approximately to the recall and precision ratios of large document retrieval
system evaluation.  A preliminary application of the method to the subject
indexing of two major encyclopedias showed one encyclopedia apparently
superior in both the finding and discrimination abilities of retrieval
performance.  The method is presently best suited for comparative testing
since its ability to yield absolute or reproducible measures is as yet not
established.
