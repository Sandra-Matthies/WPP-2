Some of the automatic classification procedures used in informationretrieval derive clusters of documents from an intermediate similarity
matrix, the computation of which involves comparing each of the documents
in the collection with all of the others.  It has recently been suggested
that many of these comparisons, specifically those between documents
having no terms in common, may be avoided by means of the uyse of an inverted
file to the document collection.  This communication shows that the
approach will effect reductions in the number of interdocument comparisons
only if the documents are each indexed by a limited number of indexing
terms; if exhaustive indexing is used, many document pairs will be compared
several times over and the computation will be greater than when
conventional approaches are used to generate the similarity matrix.
