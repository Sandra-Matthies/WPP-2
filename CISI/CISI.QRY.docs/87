A prototype system is created that integrates a microfiche cataloginto an online computer system for bibliographic control.  Costs and
operational data are collected and analyzed.  The system permits the more
economical microfiche storage of catalog records than would be feasible
for comparable online magnetic disk storage.  Experimental tests
demonstrate the feasibility of the online microfiche catalog system for use
in library technical services and retrieval of bibliographic data.  The
primary result of the project is the creation of a completely operational
facility, including all equipment, software, procedures, and data bases
necessary to demonstrate the system.  A second set of results is derived
from the experimental use of the system and the evaluation of costs and
times for various operations.  The cost effectiveness of the online microfiche
catalog is demonstrated.
