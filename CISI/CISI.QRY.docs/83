This paper describes an architectural approach that provides informationexchange across a broad spectrum of user applications and office automation
offerings.  Some of the architectures described herein are currently
implemented in existing IBM products.  These and other architectures will
provide the basis for document interchange capability between products
such as the IBM 5520 Administrative System, the IBM System/370 Distributed
Office Support System (DISOSS), and the IBM Displaywriter System.
Specifically described is a document distribution architecture and its
associated data streams and others.

    A general overview of the architectures as opposed to a detailed
technical description is provided.  The architectures described are
protocols for interchange between application processes; they do not
address the specific user interface.  The document distribution
architectures utilize SNA for data transmission and communications control
facilities.
