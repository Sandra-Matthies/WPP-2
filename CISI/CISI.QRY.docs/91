One mode of online retrieval in Scisearch or Social Scisearch involvesentering pairs of authors' names believed to be jointly cited by
subsequent writers and retrieving papers in which cocitations occur.  Six
pairs were formed with the names of four authors prominent in the social
indicators movement (Bauer, Duncan, Land, and Sheldon).  Documents by the
four were not specified.  It was thought that the pair Duncan and Land
would retrieve papers in which indicator-type data would be integrated with
path-analytic causal modeling.  All other pairs seemed likely to retrieve a
"general social indicators" literature.  The 298 retrieved papers confirmed
expectattions.  It was found that 121 papers generally cited social indicators
(SI) documents by the input authors and frequently had SI language in
their titles.  Other signs of content also identified them as papers of
the SI movement.  The 177 papers retrieved on Duncan and Land generally
cited causal modeling documents by the input pair and were path-analytic
in nature.  As expected, they were relatively "harder" than the first
group of papers, although the two groups are akin and are formally linked
through citations in certain papers.  An additional result is that papers
citing at least three of the input authors tend to be overviews of the SI
movement.
