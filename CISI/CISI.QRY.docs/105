Indexing quality determines whether the information content of an indexeddocument is accurately represented.  Indexing effectiveness measures whether
an indexed document is correctly retrieved every time it is relevant to a
query.  Measurement of these criteria is cumbersome and costly; data base
producers therefore prefer inter-indexer consistency as a measure of indexing
quality or effectiveness.  The present article assesses the validity of this
substitution in various environments.
