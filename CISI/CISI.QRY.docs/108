A technique of online instruction and assistance to bibliographic database searchers called Individualized Instruction for Data Access (IIDA) is
being developed by Drexel University.  IIDA assists searchers by providing
feedback based on real-time analysis while searches are being performed.
Extensive help facilities which draw on this analysis are available to
users.  Much of the project's experimental work, as described elsewhere,
is concerned with the process of searching and the behavior of searchers.
This paper will largely address itself to the project's computer system, which
is being developed by subcontract with the Franklin Institute's Science
Information Services.
