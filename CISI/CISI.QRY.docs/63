A commercially available online search was used as a standard forcomparative searching and evaluation of an in-house information system
based on automatic indexing.  System features were identified and
evaluated on the basis of their usefulness in various kinds of searching,
their ease in implementation, and how they are influenced by differences
in user type or specific applications.  Some common features of the
commercial system, such as online instruction, user-specified print formats,
dictionary display, and truncation, are seen to be unnecessary or
impractical for the in-house system.  In designing the in-house system,
therefore, detald consideration must be given to the applications,
operating environment, and real user needs.  While a commercial system can
serve as a useful standard for comparative evaluation, one must be
careful not to attempt to duplicate it blindly in-house.
